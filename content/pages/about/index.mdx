My name is Matthias. In my professional life I am a solution architect. In my private life I am a passionate software developer and maker.

I learnt my whole life by reading awesome books, articles, papers, videos, etc. To give something back, this blog is intended to help others solving problems or getting inspired.

This is an open-source blog stored on [Github](https://github.com/mroeckl/mroeckl.github.io) and published as Github Pages. Thank you, Github!
